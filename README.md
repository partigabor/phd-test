# phd-thesis-draft

**⚓ This project is still under work, hence all content here is tentative! ⚓**

This repository hosts the data and figures accompanying the Ph.D. thesis of Gábor Parti, which is currently being prepared at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
The sources and methods are explained, referenced, and cited in the thesis document. The repository in its present state is intended for review purposes only, aligning with an initial submission of the dissertation. Please do not download or share any content hosted here, since these datasets and figures constitute a first draft, and not a final version.
